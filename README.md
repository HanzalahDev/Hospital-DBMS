# **Hospital Management System (DBMS Project)**

## **Overview**
This is a simple hospital management system created in Python, using MySQL for the backend database. It allows users to:
- Register patients, doctors, and employees.
- Retrieve and manage hospital records.
- View specific details of patients, doctors, and employees by unique IDs.

## **Features**
- Register new patients, doctors, and employees.
- Display details of registered individuals.
- Fetch specific records using unique IDs.
- Automated database creation and table setup.

## **Requirements**
- Python 3.x
- MySQL
- Pandas library
  ```bash
  pip install pandas
## **MySQL Connector**
To install the MySQL Connector, run the following command:
```bash
pip install mysql-connector-python

## **Database Setup**
1. Start the MySQL server.
2. Create a database named `project`. (If the database doesn't exist, the script will create it automatically.)
3. Run the Python script to start managing hospital records.
